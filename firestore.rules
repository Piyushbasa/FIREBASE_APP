/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for AgriAssist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a balance between data accessibility and security.
 * It enforces ownership for write operations on most collections, ensuring
 * that users can only modify their own data. Public read access is granted
 * where appropriate to facilitate data sharing and community interaction.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /posts: A top-level collection for community forum posts, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}: A top-level collection for user profiles.
 * - /users/{userId}/...: Subcollections under a user's profile for private user data.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access to /posts allows open access to forum content.
 * - Write access to /posts is restricted to authenticated users, with owner-only editing and deletion.
 * - User profiles (/users/{userId}) are only accessible to the owning user.
 * - Data validation is relaxed in this prototyping phase to allow for rapid iteration.
 * - Denormalization is used on `posts` to avoid costly `get()` operations for ownership checks.
