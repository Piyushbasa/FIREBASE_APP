/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes a secure, owner-centric model for user data while allowing public read access to community forum posts. User profiles are private and only accessible to the owning user.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/posts/{postId}`: Community forum posts, readable by all, but writable only by authenticated users who are the authors.
 * - `/userProfile/{userId}`: User profiles, only readable and writable by the owning user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Posts are publicly readable to foster community engagement.
 * - User profiles are private and only accessible/modifiable by the corresponding user.
 * - Listing of user profiles is disallowed for privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - Posts denormalize `authorId` onto each post document to simplify ownership checks for updates and deletes.
